# Cotton Yield Analysis, Hyde County

## Summary

### Introduction
Organic cotton is a safer alternative for conventional cotton because the water and agrochemical requirements of organic cotton are relatively lower than those of latter. The client is considering certifying her 300 acres of fallow cropland organic. This analysis compares the productivity of cotton grown by conventional, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and organic management practices under different soil treatments. It also studies the effect of different concentrations of fertilizer application and identify possible interaction effect between treatments and management practices. 

### Data
The data consisted of cotton yield for parcels of land in Hyde County, NC, that was divided into 270 one-acre plots and were managed by different agricultural practices. 90 acres of land was randomly selected to be in organic, conventional, and integrated pest management (IPM) while 30 acres of land was randomly treated with 50, 75 and 100 lbs of nitrogen fertilizer per acre each.

### Statistical Analysis
One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test was performed on logged cotton yield to investigate the effect of management practices and the effect of fertilizer applications. A two-way ANOVA was also conducted to compare the means of logged cotton yield between groups based on management practices and fertilizer application. Significant differences were determined by a post-hoc analysis called Tukey Honest Significant Difference to observe how groups compare with each other. 

### Conclusion
Conventional and IPM farms were found to have higher cotton yield than organic farms. It was also found that organic farms require high amount of nitrogen fertilizer to compete with the productivity of conventional and IPM cotton. If the client prioritizes environmental and social benefits of cultivating organic cotton, high productivity can be achieved with higher fertilizer application. But conventional and IPM farming might be better choices if the client prefers to save costs on fertilizers. The assumptions of normality and equal variances for ANOVA test were not met and, therefore, some differences can occur in real world. Moreover, a few outliers were also observed in the cotton yield.
