# Cotton Yield Analysis, NC

## Summary

#### Introduction
Organic cotton is a safer alternative for conventional cotton because the water and agrochemical requirements of organic cotton are relatively lower than those of latter. The client is considering certifying her 300 acres of fallow cropland organic. This analysis compares the productivity of cotton grown by conventional, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and organic management practices under different soil treatments. It also studies the effect of different concentrations of fertilizer application and identify possible interaction effect between treatments and management practices. 

#### Dataset
The data was provided by the client. It consisted of cotton yield for parcels of land that was divided into 270 one-acre plots and were managed by different agricultural practices. 90 acres of land was randomly selected to be in organic, conventional, and integrated pest management (IPM) while 30 acres of land was randomly treated with 50, 75 and 100 lbs of nitrogen fertilizer per acre each.

#### Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics of cotton yield were calculated under different treatments. One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test was performed on logged cotton yield to investigate the effect of management practices and the effect of fertilizer applications. A two-way ANOVA was also conducted to compare the means of logged cotton yield between groups based on management practices and fertilizer application. Significant differences were determined by a post-hoc analysis called Tukey Honest Significant Difference to observe how groups compare with each other. Prior to ANOVA analysis, Shapiro Wilk test of normality and Bartlett test of equal variance for each group (i.e. for organic, conventional and IPM and for 50, 75 and 100 lbs N/acre) were conducted to find that the assumptions of normality and equal variance across each group was not met. So a non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test was conducted because it does not depend on the assumptions of normality and equal variance. The test conformed to the findings of ANOVA results for management practices and fertilizer applications.

#### Conclusion
Conventional and IPM farms were found to have higher cotton yield than organic farms. It was also found that organic farms require high amount of nitrogen fertilizer to compete with the productivity of conventional and IPM cotton. If the client prioritizes environmental and social benefits of cultivating organic cotton, high productivity can be achieved with higher fertilizer application. But conventional and IPM farming might be better choices if the client prefers to save costs on fertilizers. The assumptions of normality and equal variances for ANOVA test were not met and, therefore, some differences can occur in real world. Moreover, a few outliers were also observed in the cotton yield.
